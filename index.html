Do not surf work unrelated things
Avoid surfing personal things
Do not get distracted by world news


Remember, if you put your mind it, you can accomplish anything.
Just like I told you, put your mind into it, you can accomplish anything.

Memes are for fools
Memes are all about pop culture and mocking topics

It isn’t healthy
You want to be healthy,
Stray off the memes and personal things online


If you put your personal life on the internet,
Its very easy to be miserable,
And there’s also the paranoia of being doxxed.
